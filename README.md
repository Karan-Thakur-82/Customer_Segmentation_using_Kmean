# **Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering**

## **Project Overview**

Customer segmentation is an essential tool for businesses to understand their customer base, enhance customer retention, and drive marketing strategies based on specific customer needs. This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the **K-means clustering algorithm**, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing and customer engagement strategies effectively.

In this project, we leverage customer data to group individuals into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behaviors. These clusters can help identify key segments such as high-value customers, low-frequency buyers, or recent purchasers, ultimately enabling better-targeted marketing efforts and personalized offers.

## **Motivation**

Customer behavior varies widely, and a one-size-fits-all approach often fails to engage different customer segments effectively. By clustering customers based on their purchasing history, businesses can:
- Identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.
- Target specific segments with relevant promotions and discounts.
- Understand customer churn risks by identifying low-frequency or low-value buyers.
- Improve overall customer retention and engagement.

### **Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to group customers into meaningful segments using their purchase behavior, which includes features such as:
- **Total Purchase Amount**: The total monetary value of all purchases made by the customer.
- **Number of Transactions**: The total number of purchases or transactions.
- **Average Purchase Value**: The average value per transaction.
- **Recency**: The number of days since the customer last made a purchase.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - We begin by cleaning and preparing the customer data. This involves handling missing values, selecting relevant features, and normalizing the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
   
2. **Data Standardization**:
   - Since K-means clustering is sensitive to feature scaling, the next step involves standardizing the data using `StandardScaler` to bring all the features to the same scale, ensuring that no feature dominates the clustering process.

3. **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters (k)**:
   - Using the **Elbow method**, we determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** against the number of clusters. The elbow point in the plot indicates the most appropriate number of clusters to segment the customers into meaningful groups.

4. **K-means Clustering**:
   - The core of this project is the K-means algorithm, which partitions the data into distinct clusters by minimizing the distance between the data points and their assigned cluster centroids. Each customer is assigned to a cluster that represents similar purchasing behaviors.

5. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - After assigning each customer to a cluster, we analyze the characteristics of each group by comparing the mean values of key features across clusters. This analysis helps understand the unique behaviors of different customer segments.
   - For instance, some clusters may represent high-spending, frequent shoppers, while others may be characterized by low-spending, infrequent buyers.

6. **Data Visualization**:
   - Multiple visualizations are created to better understand the distribution of customer behaviors within each cluster. These include:
     - **Bar plots** to compare the average feature values across clusters.
     - **Box plots** to visualize the spread and distribution of purchasing behaviors for each feature within the clusters.
     - **Pair plots** to observe relationships between different features and how they vary by cluster.
     - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is used to reduce dimensionality for visualizing clusters in a 2D space.

7. **Interpretation of Clusters**:
   - Each cluster is interpreted based on its unique feature values:
     - **High-value customers** who make frequent, large purchases.
     - **Low-value, infrequent customers** with low total purchase amounts.
     - **Recent customers** who have purchased recently but may have low overall spending.
   - This insight can inform marketing strategies such as personalized promotions, targeting specific clusters with relevant offers, or designing loyalty programs for high-value customers.

## **Technologies and Tools Used**

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **pandas & numpy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: The machine learning library used for implementing the K-means clustering algorithm and data scaling.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization, including scatter plots, bar charts, and pair plots to understand the clustering results visually.

## **Key Visualizations**

- **Elbow Method**: Helps in selecting the optimal number of clusters by plotting WCSS against the number of clusters.
- **Bar Plots**: Show the average values of each feature (Total Purchase, Transactions, etc.) for each cluster, helping compare behaviors across customer segments.
- **Box Plots**: Visualize the distribution of each feature within clusters, providing insights into feature variability and the presence of outliers.
- **Pair Plots**: Explore relationships between features, colored by cluster, to understand how different variables interact across segments.
- **2D PCA Visualization**: Projects high-dimensional data into two dimensions for easy visualization of clusters.

## **Project Results and Insights**

After running the K-means clustering algorithm and analyzing the resulting customer segments, we observed several key insights:
- **Cluster 0**: High-value, frequent buyers who made large purchases consistently. This segment is ideal for loyalty programs and high-value promotions.
- **Cluster 1**: Low-frequency, low-value buyers. This group may need targeted marketing campaigns or incentives to increase their purchase frequency.
- **Cluster 2**: Customers with a high recency score but low purchase amounts, potentially indicating new or re-engaged customers.
- **Cluster 3**: Mid-value buyers with moderate transaction frequency. These customers could be nurtured into high-value customers with personalized offers.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the power of **K-means clustering** in understanding customer behaviors and creating actionable customer segments. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing history, businesses can make data-driven decisions for marketing, sales, and customer engagement. The insights gained from customer segmentation help in resource allocation, designing targeted campaigns, and improving overall customer satisfaction.
